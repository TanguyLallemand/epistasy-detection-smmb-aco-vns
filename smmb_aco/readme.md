# SMMB-ACO documentation
## Stochastic Multiple Markov Blankets with Ant COlony Optimization (SMMB-ACO)
SMMB-ACO is a programm permitting to find epistasy patterns using Multiple Markov Blankets generated by ant colony optimization.

## Compilation instructions
In order to compile this method a makefile was given at the root of SMMB-ACO's folder. Please notice that a general makefile was generated at the project's root permitting to produce and executable including both methods.
### Preparation of pre requist
In the makefile please change BOOST_FOLDER value with path of the installed boost library on current workstation.
Moreover, please check if current g++ version is compatible with C++11 functionalities (version >= 5.0). Please also check boost library. Authors cannot garanty compatibility with other boost version even if boost version seems to be compatible. For this method version 1.61.0 was employed.
### Compilation
To compile this method, please call thoses lines a the root of the project:

    cd smmb_aco
    make

I a recompilation is needed use:

    make clean

Execute program with:

    ./smmb_aco.exe
<!-- TODO mettre ici le call de smmb -->
## Parameters
Parameters of this programms are stored in parameters folder into a file called parameters.txt. This file is commented to permit an easy setup for particular needs.
## Launch the analysis of the toy dataset
With this project is provided a python script allowing a simple launch on every platform equiped with python. This script will launch programm on a naive dataset with default configuration given by authors.
To execute this script please call:

    ./launch_toy_dataset_analysis.py
## Expected output
This method give as output a txt file gathering all results. Those results can be checked using our evaluaton tool given in evaluation folder.
Using toy dataset:
